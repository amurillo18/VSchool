                  My background in technology gave me the ability to solve problems and think outside of the box. I use this experience to build beautiful, user-friendly websites that generate traffic and promote your products and/or services. As your web developer, I will work endlessly to modify your websites to your specifications to direct more traffic to your site and increase your revenue.

                  I have earned a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Information Technology at Western Governors University, which specializes in Full-Stack Web Development. My ultimate goal is to become an SME in my industry and I plan to accomplish that by continuing my education through classes or personal experience.
